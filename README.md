# MyChunk 2.6 [1.8 Compatable] 

Hello! This plugin is an updated version of the one ellbristow developed which is now abandoned.

The heavy work was done by brc (updating the plugin to 1.8), check out his repo over yonder: https://github.com/brcDev/MyChunk.

The following changes have been made by me:
  - Updated Vault to 1.5 (From 1.4.1)
  - Updated factions and MassiveCore to 2.7.4 (from 2.7.3)
  - **Diabled** (Not removed) the /gang command due to the fact it is not fully complete.

This plugin can be used with the following plugins:

  - WorldGuard 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT (You **must** Get it here: http://builds.enginehub.org/job/worldguard/6524) The plugin won't run with WorldGuard 6.0.0 Beta 2 from Bukkit.org!
  - WorldEdit 6.0.1
  - Vault 1.5
  - Factions 2.7.4
  - MassiveCore 2.7.4
  - Towny Advanced 0.89.0.0
  
There are no know bugs. If you find one please submit an issue.

Thanks!
